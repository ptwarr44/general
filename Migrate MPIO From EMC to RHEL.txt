RED HAT Move MPIO from EMC to RHEL native tools

1) Remove/uninstall the emc package per EMC's process
	- systemctl disable PowerPath
	- systemctl disable PowerPathPost-start
	- Comment out the FS (or multiple) using PowerPath
	- Reboot
	- rpm -ev EMC-Power*

2)Change the lvm filter to scan mpath devices rather than emcpower devices in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf:
	filter = [ "a|3600605b00a5a4aa01d719410192afca8|", "a|/dev/mapper/mpath*|", "r|.*|" ]
	global_filter = [ "a|3600605b00a5a4aa01d719410192afca8|", "a|/dev/mapper/mpath.*|", "r|.*|" ]

3)Follow this process to start our mpio:
  https://access.redhat.com/solutions/66281

Note: you have already installed device-mapper-multipath so you may skip that step, so you should just need to run:
  # mpathconf --enable --user_friendly_names y
  # multipath -v2
  # multipath -ll

and confirm your multipath devices have formed.

4)Check to ensure your PV's are not using your multipath devices:
  # pvscan --cache
  # pvs -v | grep mpath

Once confirmed, activate and mount:
  # vgchange -ay
  # mount -a
  
 Enable and start multipath
  # systemctl start multipathd
  # systemctl enable multipathd
